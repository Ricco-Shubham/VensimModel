I developed a system dynamics (SD) model to optimize cloud costs by analyzing the interaction between resource consumption, provisioning, and cost variables. Using VensimÂ© software, the model enables simulations to identify the impact of various factors on cloud resource utilization and costs. The study highlights strategies for maintaining cost-effectiveness while ensuring optimal service quality through "what-if" scenario analyses. This approach provides decision-makers with valuable insights for creating efficient cloud resource management policies, balancing cost and productivity, and enabling data-driven decisions.

Key outcomes include:

ðŸ”·Enhanced understanding of cloud cost dynamics using causal loop and stock flow diagrams.
ðŸ”·Optimized resource provisioning strategies through autoscaling mechanisms.
ðŸ”·Demonstrated cost savings and operational efficiency through dynamic pricing adjustments.
ðŸ”·Validation of the SD model through sensitivity analysis and real-world data simulations.

This research equips cloud service managers with tools to improve resource utilization, control costs, and achieve sustainability in cloud operations.
